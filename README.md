features:

- Written in HTML5, Canvas, CSS3 and (oldschool) Javascript
- CreateJS libraries were used to preload assets and help with some game functions
- Graphics and sound effects taken from Opengameart, Nosoapradio and adapted using Adobe software
- The game is tile-based and consists of 350 locations (and yes, there is some repetition)
- Several themes were created with each having distinct visuals and sound
- The game features weather and lighting effects and some interesting puzzles, give it a go!
- Your character is controlled using WASD+CTRL or cursor keys + space bar
- Some basic mouse and -touch support was added as an afterthought
- The entire project took me only 3 weeks so please do not take it too seriously!
